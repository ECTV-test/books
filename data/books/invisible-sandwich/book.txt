The Invisible Sandwich

Chapter 1: The Best Sandwich

Tim is hungry, so he goes to the kitchen.
“I want a big sandwich!” he says.
He gets some bread and adds cheese, tomato, and lettuce.
Then he finds peanut butter and says, “Yes!”
He adds pickles and says, “Weird, but okay,” then puts chocolate on top and says, “Yum!”
Finally, he places the top slice of bread.
“It’s perfect!” Tim smiles as he puts the sandwich on the table.
But then the phone rings, so he runs to answer it.
“Hello?” Tim says.
It’s just a robot voice: “BEEP! You win a free umbrella!”
Tim hangs up, walks back to the kitchen, and looks at the table.
But the sandwich is… gone.

Chapter 2: It Disappears!
Tim looks at the table and says, “No sandwich?”
He checks under the table but finds nothing.
He looks in the trash can — empty.
He opens the fridge — nope.
Tim feels confused.
“I made it and I saw it, so where is it?” he wonders.
He checks his pocket, but it’s too small for a sandwich.
“Did I eat it?” he asks as he looks at his mouth in the mirror, but he sees no crumbs.
He walks around the house and sees something on the floor — a breadcrumb! 
“Aha!” he says, and quickly follows the trail.

Chapter 3: The Crumbs Trail
The first crumb is in the kitchen, the second is in the hallway, and the third is by the sofa.
“Someone took my sandwich,” Tim says. “Someone is eating it now!”
He follows more crumbs as they lead to the stairs.
Up… up… up…
Now he is in the bedroom, and he sees more crumbs on the rug.
“Hello?” Tim says. “Who is here?”
Suddenly, the door opens — it’s the dog!
The dog’s mouth is clean, but wait — there’s cheese stuck to his tail!
“Was it you?” Tim asks.
The dog wags his tail but says nothing — of course, he’s a dog.

Chapter 4: Suspect List
Tim writes a list:
SUSPECTS:
Dog – happy, has cheese tail
Sister – always hungry
Ghost – maybe?
Mouse?
He finds his sister and asks, “Did you take my sandwich?”
“Nope,” she says. “I ate cereal,” and Tim sees that the cereal box is open.
He frowns and says, “I will solve this. I am a Sandwich Detective!”

Chapter 5: Hidden Clue
Tim walks to the kitchen again and looks closely at the table.
“Oh!” he says as he spots something small — a bite mark on the edge of the table.
“A ghost doesn’t bite wood,” Tim says.
“A mouse is too small, and a dog can bite — but this bite is small, like mine…”
He looks around, but no one is there — just him.
Then he remembers the phone, the robot voice, and the call...
Wait — was he chewing during the call?
“Did I eat my sandwich without even knowing it?” he asks.

Chapter 6: The Truth
Tim sits on the floor and says, “I ate my sandwich, but I don’t remember it.”
He starts to laugh.
“I was so hungry, I ate it too fast!”
He looks in the mirror, and now he sees a little ketchup on his chin.
Mystery solved.
The sandwich wasn’t invisible — it was just delicious!
Tim smiles and says, “I want another one!”
This time, he makes a small one with just cheese and tomato — no pickles, no chocolate.
He eats it slowly, and this time, he remembers it.
The end.
